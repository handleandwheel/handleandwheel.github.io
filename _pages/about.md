I am a senior student at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), majoring in Automation in [School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation (SMEA)](http://smea.hitsz.edu.cn/).

Previously, I joined WTRobot (WTR), a robot team supervised by Prof. [Yunjiang LOU](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/louyunjiang) and Prof. [Xiaogang Xiong](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xiongxiaogang), and participated in [ABU RoboCon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon) in both 2021 and 2022. In 2022, I joined a research project supervied by Prof. [Xiong Hao](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xionghao), addressing obstacle avoidance for cable-driven parallel robot.

Currently, I am working with Prof. [Xuanyu Cao](http://eexcao.people.ust.hk/) and Prof. [Jiangang Li](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/lijiangang) on my Graduation Project. I am developing algorithms to minimize the impact of noise on the performance of wireless decentralized federated learning.
