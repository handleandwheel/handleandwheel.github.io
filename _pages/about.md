I am a research assistant at [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS)](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en), advised by Prof. [Tin Lun LAM](https://sites.google.com/site/lamtinlun), and my research interest in multi-robot localization.

Previously, I was student at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), majoring in Automation in [School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation (SMEA)](http://smea.hitsz.edu.cn/). In HITSZ, I joined WTRobot (WTR), a robot team supervised by Prof. [Yunjiang LOU](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/louyunjiang) and Prof. [Xiaogang Xiong](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xiongxiaogang), and participated in [ABU RoboCon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon) in both 2021 and 2022. In 2022, I joined a research project supervied by Prof. [Xiong Hao](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xionghao), addressing obstacle avoidance for cable-driven parallel robot. I completed my Graduation Project under the supervision of Prof. [Xuanyu Cao](http://eexcao.people.ust.hk/) and Prof. [Jiangang Li](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/lijiangang) in June 2023, where I developed algorithms to minimize the impact of noise on the performance of wireless decentralized federated learning.

I will be an MPhil student at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in Spring 2024, majoring in Articial Intelligence and Robotics, supervised by Prof. LAM.
